#### Insights:
The above histogram presents the distribution of Uber pickups based on the time.
The busiest time for Uber pickups is around **5 P.M.**. 
This could be due to the end of the workday when people are likely heading home. 
There is a moderate activity throughout the day. 
Afternoon hours are marked by higher activity compared to morning hours.
